# Hey, I'm Urmzd! 👋

**Urmzd Mukhammadnaim** · /ʊərˈmuːzd mʊˌhɑːmɑdˈnaɪm/

I'm a Software Engineer who loves building AI-powered systems and turning complex problems into elegant solutions. Currently focused on RAG architectures, LLM tooling, and making machines a little smarter.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me running, lifting, or diving into a good book.

Check out what I'm up to at **[urmzd.com](https://urmzd.com)** — I write about projects, share thoughts, and occasionally ramble about tech.
