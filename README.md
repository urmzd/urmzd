# urmzd

Man approaches the unattainable truth through a succession of errors. Based in Austin, TX, I build robust systems and explore the boundaries of technology, with a focus on Rust, TypeScript, Go, Java, and Python.

My expertise spans machine learning, web development, systems programming, and DevOps. I enjoy architecting ML pipelines with TensorFlow and PyTorch, crafting performant web apps with React and Astro, and automating environments using Rust, Go, Nix, and Chezmoi. I also contribute to backend APIs and data science projects, leveraging modern frameworks and tools.

Notable projects include resume-generator (CLI tool for PDF resumes), flappy-bird (JavaFX desktop game), chess-cli (Python chess engine), lepus-classifier (CNN research), and dotfiles (one-command dev environment bootstrap).
