Man approaches the unattainable truth through a succession of errors. Based in Austin, TX, I explore the boundaries of technology through iterative learning and practical experimentation.

My work spans machine learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras), web development (React, TypeScript, Astro), and systems programming (Rust, Go, Shell). I enjoy building robust automation pipelines, optimizing backend APIs, and crafting developer environments with Nix and Chezmoi. Rust, TypeScript, and Go are my most-used languages, reflecting my focus on performance, reliability, and modern software design.

Notable projects include resume-generator (CLI tool for customizable PDF resumes), flappy-bird (JavaFX desktop game), chess-cli (Python chess engine), lepus-classifier (CNN research), and dotfiles (one-command environment bootstrap).
