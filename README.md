Man approaches the unattainable truth through a succession of errors. Based in Austin, TX, I explore the boundaries of technology through experimentation and iterative learning.

My work spans machine learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras), systems programming (Rust, Go, Shell, Nix), and modern web development (TypeScript, React, Astro). I also contribute to DevOps workflows, backend APIs, and scientific computing, with Rust and TypeScript as my most-used languages.

Notable projects include resume-generator (CLI tool for customizable PDF resumes), flappy-bird (JavaFX desktop game), chess-cli (Python chess engine), lepus-classifier (CNN research for small datasets), and dotfiles (one-command environment bootstrap).
