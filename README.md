# Urmzd Mukhammadnaim

I'm Urmzd Mukhammadnaim, based in Austin, TX. I believe that progress is made through a succession of errors—each iteration brings us closer to the truth.

My work centers on systems programming, CLI tools, and machine learning, with a strong focus on Rust, Go, TypeScript, and Python. I also enjoy building web applications and automating development workflows, drawing from experience in React, Astro, and DevOps tools like GitHub Actions and Docker.

Some of my notable projects include resume-generator, a CLI tool for generating customizable resumes from structured data; flappy-bird, a JavaFX desktop game showcasing data-oriented design; chess-cli, a Python-based command-line chess game; and lepus-classifier, a research project exploring CNN architectures for small datasets. I maintain modern dotfiles for streamlined development environments using Chezmoi and Nix.

I value clean architecture, reproducible setups, and practical solutions—always learning from the journey.
