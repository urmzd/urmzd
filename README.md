#### About Me

👨💻 As a **Software Engineer**, I am passionate about leveraging technology to shape our future. My coding philosophy is inspired by the principles of martial arts - adaptability, precision, and continuous improvement. I believe that good code, like a well-executed martial arts technique, should be intuitive, elegant, and effective.

🥋 Beyond my technical pursuits, I'm an avid practitioner of **Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) and Muay Thai**. These disciplines have taught me the value of strategy, resilience, and adaptability - principles I apply in my software development. The cross-application of strategies from BJJ and Muay Thai to coding highlights my belief in the interconnectedness of all disciplines.

🧘 Embracing **mindfulness** in both my personal and professional life, I find it enhances creativity, focus, and problem-solving abilities. This practice keeps me balanced and grounded, enabling me to approach challenges with a clear and open mind.

📚 An enthusiast of **reading**, I immerse myself in a variety of subjects to stay curious and continuously evolve. I see each book as an opportunity to gain new insights, which in turn influence my approach to software development and life.
